# Responsive-form-with-validation
The provided code represents an HTML form with inline JavaScript for form validation. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The HTML structure:
   - The HTML form consists of a table with various input fields for user information and corresponding `<span>` elements for error messages.
   - Each input field has an `id` attribute to uniquely identify them.
   - The form has an `action` attribute set to "#" to prevent form submission.
   - The `<script>` tag is placed at the end of the HTML body to ensure that the HTML elements are loaded before accessing them.

2. JavaScript code:
   - The JavaScript code starts by retrieving the value of the "mobile" input field but isn't used further in the code.
   - The `validation()` function is called when the form is submitted.
   - Inside the `validation()` function, the values of various input fields are retrieved.
   - Then, the validation logic is applied to each input field.
   - The `validateEmail()`, `validatePassword()`, and `validateMobileNumber()` functions are defined within the `validation()` function to validate email, password, and mobile number inputs, respectively.
   - If any validation fails, an error message is displayed by setting the `innerHTML` of the corresponding `<span>` element to the error message.
   - If all validations pass, the respective `<span>` elements' `innerHTML` is cleared, indicating a successful validation.
   - The `validateEmail()` function uses a regular expression pattern to check if the email input is in a valid format.
   - The `validatePassword()` function checks the password length and ensures it contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
   - The `validateMobileNumber()` function uses a regular expression pattern to check if the mobile number input consists of 10 digits.

Note: The code provided should work for basic form validation, but there are a few improvements you can consider, such as separating the JavaScript code into a separate file and using event listeners instead of inline event handling.
